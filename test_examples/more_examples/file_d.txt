80 days around the world.
We’ll find a pot of gold
just sitting where the rainbow’s ending.

There’s a voice that keeps on calling me.
Who’s intellectual close friends get to call him T.C.,
providing it’s with dignity.

Time — we’ll fight against the time,
and we’ll fly on the white wings of the wind.

no we won’t say a word before
the ship is really back.
